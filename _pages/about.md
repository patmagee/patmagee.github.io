I am a Software Developer and Bioinformatician working out of my home from Kingston, Ontario. I joined [DNAstack](https://dnastack.com)
in early 2016 with the vision of building the next generation "Internet of Genomics" by developing standards based tools for data anlaysis, sharing, discovery and authorization. 
I have since helped manage the development of DNAstack's core applications in the cloud and lead the internal bioinformatics team.

I am passionate about open source technologies, cloud computing, distributed systems, performant applications and am a vocal advocate of reproducible and open science. 
For the past four years I have been involved in the [GA4GH](https://ga4gh.org) community and contribute to their open source projects driving the creation of 
standards for the health and genomics sectors. I also am part of the governance committee of [OpenWDL](http://openwdl.org) guiding 
the development of the [Workflow Descriptor Language](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) and help evangelize the bioinformatics community to the power of distributed data analysis.

In my spare time, I passionately pursue classical guitar, enjoy nature with my wife and getitng involved in my local community.
